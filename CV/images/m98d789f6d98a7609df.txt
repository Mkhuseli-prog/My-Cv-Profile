Hi, 
Please don't send proposal until you get the complete details and we ask you to send proposal.

First of all contact Mr Chris through telegram at cri552 (https://t.me/cri552) or you can send email at sti632@outlook.com to MR Allen (but response on email will be much slower)
then we'll provide you with complete details afterward you decide if you should go for it or not


Thank you.
